In Sql
-server generates the newid for new records
-uses auto-increment


In mongoDB
-They are guid--globally unique....so chance of collision
-Server need not decide the next Id
-This allow MongoDB to scale well in a Distributed System

eg user with id 1 in one Database server and
   user with id 1 in other Database server

a 4-byte timestamp value, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch
