1)What is Node.js
-It's a JavaScript Runtime
-Allows JavaScript code to run on server

2)How does it run js code on server
-It uses the javascript engine V8  which is built by google
-V8 is used to run the javascript in the browser
-V8 takes the javascript code and compiles it to the machine code
-V8 is written in C++

3)why to use Node.js
-It's uses an event driven, non blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient
I/O example
- Node app wants to communicate with the machine it's running on- that's I/O
- Node app wants to communicate with some other server eg: querying a database- that's I/O
while these I/O operations are occuring..the node.js application can do other things like
processing other request

IMP
-Node.js takes that code base of V8 that is written in C++ and
ADDS certain features to V8 codebase like -- working with local files etc
like ..reading files,creating files and deleting files...connecting with database
ALSO SOME FEATURE ARE TAKEN AWAY - like working with DOM


4) npm init creates configuration file called package.json which will manage
all the dependencies

5)IMP  Node Modules directory can be recreated from scratch using package.json
so no need to include node modules directory in git ... run npm install
npm install command looks at the content of the package.json file
and recreates the node modules directory with all the modules specified inside package.json

6)IMP
Just like we have document in the browser,
  we have PROCESS in node...which is a large object

7)Remember to export from a file whenever we want to import that file
