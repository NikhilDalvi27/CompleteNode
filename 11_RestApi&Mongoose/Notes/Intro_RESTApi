Representational State Transfer- Application Programming Interface(REST Api or RESTful Api)

API - set of tools that allow you to build a software
eg: fs module in Node

REST - allows client to access/or manipulate a resource using a set of predefined operations
eg: Create a New Task/ Mark a task as Complete

State Transfer- REST Api is stateless
State is transferred from server to the client
Each request from client contains everything that is needed for the server to process that request
